# Yet Another Satoshi Website

[satoshi.si](https://satoshi.si) â€” a project dedicated to preserving and sharing the words of Satoshi. While the project doesn't have a strict direction, it certainly carries a meaningful purpose.

## What You Can Find Here

- **Satoshi Quotes**: All known quotes from Satoshi Nakamoto are displayed here, randomly and in no particular order. You can click on any quote to copy it instantly.

- **Nostr NIP-05 Identifiers**: We're offering NIP-05 identifiers with the satoshi.si domain, such as `fckfiat@satoshi.si`.

- **Bitcoin Whitepaper Translations**: All current translations of the Bitcoin whitepaper are hosted here, with the option to add more. My aim is to make these translations available years faster than the official Bitcoin.org website, which has seen stagnation recently. This project was inspired by the efforts of the Slovenian Bitcoin Association, who put significant effort into translating the Slovenian Bitcoin whitepaper and following all of Bitcoin.org's protocols, only to experience delays. While George from the Translators group responded, progress has been slow. Thus, this platform was created as a simpler and more efficient way for contributors to the Bitcoin comunity to share their work.

- **Future Features**: I plan to add more fun and useful features to this site, especially if Bitcoin.org continues to delay the publication of new translated whitepapers.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's adding new quotes, improving the site, or submitting a new translation of the Bitcoin whitepaper, your input is valuable. Please feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. I'm trying to keep this project in HTML, CSS and JS only so I can reach more people who are willing to contribute.
