        <section>
            <h2>4. Game Mechanics</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Betting Process</h3>
            <p>Each lottery entry requires a payment of exactly 1 satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). All payments must be processed exclusively through the Lightning Network. Players select a unique 8-digit number ranging from 00000001 to 99999999. Multiple participants may select the same number, creating shared winning opportunities.</p>
            
            <h3>4.2 Betting Schedule</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Betting Window opens at Bitcoin Block 1 of each 100-block cycle</li>
                <li>Closes at Bitcoin Block 96</li>
                <li>Suspension period during Blocks 97-99</li>
                <li>Drawing occurs at Block 100</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4.3 Drawing Schedule</h3>
            <p>Lottery drawings occur automatically every 100 Bitcoin blocks, approximately once every 16-17 hours. The exact timing depends on Bitcoin network hash rate and block discovery times.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Winning Number Determination</h2>
            <h3>5.1 Cryptographic Process</h3>
            <p>The winning number is determined through a provably fair process using Bitcoin Block 100's hash. The complete block hash is obtained, cleared of letters, and the last 8 digits produce the winning number between 00000001 and 99999999.</p>
            
            <h3>5.2 Transparency & Verification</h3>
            <p>This mathematical process is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Completely transparent and verifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain</li>
                <li>Impossible to manipulate or predict in advance</li>
                <li>Auditable by any participant using publicly available blockchain data</li>
                <li>Deterministic and reproducible by independent third parties</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>6. Prize Distribution</h2>
            <h3>6.1 Jackpot Structure</h3>
            <p>The jackpot consists of 100% of all valid bet payments collected during the betting period. 86% of the total jackpot is distributed to winners across six prize tiers, with 14% retained for operational expenses.</p>
            
            <h3>6.2 Six-Tier Prize System</h3>
            <p>Prize distribution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tier 1 (8 matches) - 40%</li>
                <li>Tier 2 (7 matches) - 25%</li>
                <li>Tier 3 (6 matches) - 15%</li>
                <li>Tier 4 (5 matches) - 10%</li>
                <li>Tier 5 (4 matches) - 6%</li>
                <li>Tier 6 (3 matches) - 4%</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>6.3 Matching Methodology</h3>
            <p>All prize tier matches are determined by comparing digits from the right side of both the winning number and participant's chosen number.</p>
            
            <h3>6.4 Payout Distribution</h3>
            <p>If only one participant matches the required digits for a specific tier, they receive the entire allocation for that tier. If multiple participants match, that tier's allocation is divided equally among all winners.</p>
            
            <h3>6.5 Rollover Mechanism</h3>
            <p>If no participant matches the required digits for any specific tier, that tier's allocation rolls over to the subsequent lottery round, creating potentially larger prizes in future draws.</p>
        </section>
