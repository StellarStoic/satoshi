        <h3>Still interested?</h3>

        <p>So, you've decided to invest in your personalized human-readable NIP-05 address.<br>
            <br>
            First, you need to know that this is a manual process on my side and sometimes could take up to 24h to add your data into the system<br>
            because, I have a not IT-related job and I do need to sleep sometimes. So, please be patient if I don't respond immediately.<br>
            <br>
            You can find my socials in the <a href="contact.html">contacts</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            After you send me your desired characters and your Public Key,  
            I will add your data into the system. I'll let you know when it's ready , so you can try it before you make a final payment.
            When you successfully add your new Nip-05 address to Nostr, you'll get a lightning Invoice.<br>
            <br>
            If a payment is not made in 24h after receiving the invoice. I'll delete your data from the system. Simple as that.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you somehow decided that you don't want this ID anymore you had enough time to think about it before you've made a final payment.<br>
            <strong>I don't do refunds.</strong><br>
            Sell it on Craigslist or something idk. All I can do is to nuke it and give others a chance to own it.<br>
            <br>
            Every payment I'll receive, will go to the longevity of the domain and not for making profits.
